      <description>My name is Brett Goss. I used to make coffee, and now I write code.
I graduated from Lighthouse Labs in December of 2016, and spent the next six months working for an agency in Victoria, BC called PurposeSocial. During that time, I worked primarily with Sitka Surf Co. to rebuild their online Shopify Store, with a focus on both mobile and desktop usability, as well as improving conversions.
I have more side projects than I&amp;rsquo;d like to admit - the most notable of which is Plantia: a web app for keeping track of your houseplants&amp;rsquo; watering schedules.</description>
